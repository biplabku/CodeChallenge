public class knapsackProblem {

    // the knapsack problem is as follows: given a set of integers S= {1,2,5,9,10}, and a given
    // target number 22, find a subset of S which adds up exactly to T.
    // find counterexamples to each of the following algorithms for the knapsack problem. That is give an S
    // and T such that the subset is selected using the algorithm does not leave the knapsack completly full, even
    // though such a soltuion exists


    // Solution =
    // 1. Put the elements of S in the Knapsack in left to right order if they fit, i.e. the first-fit algorithms?
    // 2. Put the elements of S in the knapsack from smallest to largest, i.e. the best fit algotihms
    // 3. Put the elements of S in the knapsack from largest to smallest?
